# Airlines Dataset to predict a delay

This project aims to use the data from Kaggle, 'Airlines Dataset to predict a delay' to predict the delay probability given input. 

## Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Implement and compare different machine learning methods for predicting delay chance.

2. Evaluate the out-of-sample predictive performance of these methods using mean squared prediction error (MSPE) and out-of-sample R-squared (R2_oos).

3. Preditict the probability of delaying for a given customers
   
## Data

The project uses the following datasets:

1. Airlines.csv 


## Code Structure

The code for this project is organized as follows:

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Place the raw datasets in the `data/` directory.
3. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook to execute the code and reproduce the results.

## Results

The main findings of this project are:

1. Machine learning methods, particularly neural networks, can capture a significant amount of time-series variation in expected bond excess returns and outperform traditional benchmarks like PCR.

For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the `main.ipynb` notebook and the `results/` directory.
